      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&quot;While it is an
      expensive service it is no longer exclusively reserved for Fortune
      500 climbers and seven figure athletes. Many people are hiring
      coaches for all areas of their lives, including career, personal,
      sports, business, skill enhancement, and life balance.&quot;

      - April 14, 2000 <BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&quot;Individual coaching
      has come in vogue across the country for everyone from lawyers
      to accountants. But nowhere does it seem to make more sense than
      in the invent-as-you-go world of technology.&quot;&nbsp; &quot;...often
      the coach is a sounding board for a lonely executive struggling
      to find success or happiness in a profession that, more than
      any other, can demand instant results and serve up crushing defeat.
      It's rare to have think time, and coaching gives you the opportunity
      one or two hours a week to hear yourself think.&quot; <BR>
      &nbsp;&quot;...companies are increasingly adding employee perks
      such as legal services, free lunches, employee-assistance programs,
      and now coaching.&quot; <BR>
      &nbsp; <BR>
      <B>FAST COMPANY&nbsp; - March, 2000 <BR>
      </B>&quot;Even world-class athletes can't reach peak performance
      without a great coach.&quot; <BR>
      &nbsp; <BR>
      <B>FORTUNE MAGAZINE - February 21, 2000 <BR>
      </B>&quot;...in the past five years coaching has gone mass-market.
      In the age of Every Man for Himself, every man can have a coach--and,
      in an ever more commonly held view, needs one.&quot; </FONT><FONT

      </FONT><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">AUSTIN BUSINESS JOURNAL
      - February 14, 2000 <BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&quot;People from all
      walks of life -- especially professionals -- are working with
      life coaches to help them develop a game plan for their lives
      and to show them how to stick with it to achieve greater professional
      and personal satisfaction.&quot; <BR>
      &nbsp; <BR>
      <B>THE GOOD LIFE - February, 2000 <BR>
      </B>&quot;Many coaching clients have attained a certain level
      of success in their careers and are generally well-adjusted but
      find something lacking in their lives. They may want to go into
      an entirely new field, figure out how to downshift in their current
      jobs, or live more in conjunction with their true values.&quot;
<BR>
      &nbsp; <BR>
      <B>PC WEEK - December 20, 1999 <BR>
      </B>&quot;For years there have been career coaches and executive
      coaches.&nbsp; Now there's a new category, called &quot;life
      coach.&quot; The life coach combines personal, professional and
      career coaching and, it seems, is filling a need that is not
      quite being addressed by any other source.&quot; &quot;There
      are several reasons why a life coach ... makes sense. First,
      a life coach can go into topics such as marriage, nutrition and
      exercise that co-workers, bosses and even HR are loath to broach
      unless there's a crisis. Second, men and women today are trying
      to balance family obligations with a successful career path.
      Third, employees may not open up to a manager, for fear that
      the manager will see them as unable to deal with problems. Fourth,
      a life coach can be objective about job opportunities both inside
      and outside the company.&quot; <BR>
      &nbsp; <BR>
      <B>BUSINESS WEEK - October 11, 1999 <BR>
      </B>&quot;As for coaching, having someone listen to you and encourage
      you, and break everything down into easy, concrete steps, is
      rather nice.&quot; &quot;It's not just helping them with hard-core
      business issues but also helping them with their personal issues...&quot;
<BR>
      &nbsp; <BR>
      <B>BLACK ENTERPRISE - September, 1999 <BR>
      </B>&quot;'Mentors for hire' are a relatively new phenomenon,
      but the demand is increasing. The number of trained coaches--people
      who help executives achieve professional and personal goals--has
      more than tripled since 1996...&quot; &quot;Unlike management
      consultants, coaches use a personalized, philosophical approach
      that focuses on career and life issues, and follow up to ensure
      the executive's progress.&quot; </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
      &nbsp; <BR>
      </FONT><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">ORLANDO SENTINEL - July
      18, 1999 <BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&quot;A good coach is
      a listener and a guide, compassionate but firm, savvy in the
      ways of the world but open to matters of the heart - a compatriot
      who wants more than anything to see you succeed, a mom and pop
      dedicated to your own dreams, as opposed to what they had in
      mind for you. It's almost like having a functional family at
      the other end of the line.&quot; &quot;Coaching clearly suits
      an age of pressurized ambition, when more and more people have
      less and less time to make the most of lives and livelihood.&quot;
      </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
      &nbsp; <BR>
      </FONT><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">FAMILY THERAPY NETWORKER
      - May/June, 1999 <BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&quot;Not a therapist,
      not a consultant, not exactly a friend and definitely not a gym
      rat, a personal coach is more like a midwife of happiness, encouraging
      clients to name their goals and achieve them.&quot; &quot;People
      pay for coaching skills because they have a need. They've tried
      [attaining their goals] themselves. They've tried to set up networks
      with friends and they fell apart.&quot; &quot;The top-level people,
      professional athletes and executives, have had this for a long
      time. Now the masses do, too.&quot; &quot;...in this period of
      rapid social and economic change, when career shifts, family
      disintegration and sensory bombardment are the norm, a perceptive
      coach can provide a steadying presence in dizzying moments of
      change.&quot; <BR>
      &nbsp; <BR>
      <B>INFOWORLD - May 24, 1999 <BR>
      </B>&quot;Anybody who actively wants to move up in a company,
      make their job easier, have more fun, have more personal time,
      and still excel in their job needs a coach.&quot; &quot;A coach
      can [help] you get over the hump of a lot of issues you face
      and keep that motivation going.&quot; &quot;Clients also say
      that coaches give them a fresh perspective.&quot; <BR>
      &nbsp; <BR>
      <B>THE MILWAUKEE BUSINESS JOURNAL - April 12, 1999 <BR>
      </B>&quot;For a small business person, it helps to have an outside
      person to share goals and objectives with and keep an eye on
      the bigger picture.&quot; &quot;Encouragement is often the greatest
      service the coach provides.&quot; </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>

      - August 1998</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> <BR>
      &quot;...Coaching delivers value to anyone seeking to move forward
      inpersonal and business life.&nbsp; For a company, organization,
      or small business, the return on investment is high, easily recognizable,
      and apparent soon after coaching begins.&quot; <BR>
      &nbsp; <BR>
      <B>APPROACH - RENO AIR IN-FLIGHT MAGAZINE - March 1998 <BR>
      </B>&quot;Chances are if you are highly motivated, are already
      successful and yearn to be more so, you have a coach.&quot;&nbsp;
      &quot;...it's no fad &shy; the profession is escalating in the
      same way that business is changing.&quot;&nbsp; &quot;Soon, rather
      than asking, 'What is a coach?' people will be posing this question:
      'Who is your coach?'&quot; <BR>
      &nbsp; <BR>
      <B>CHICAGO TRIBUNE - February 2, 1998 <BR>
      </B>&quot;We need some undistracted steering and grooming, prodding
      and propping up. We need someone to persuade us when we fall
      to get back on the ice, the slope, the course. All of us could
      benefit from someone who always is there to beam good wishes
      from the sidelines.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">&quot; <BR>

      &quot;...coaching is clearly superior to training. It is far

      <B>THE HARTFORD COURANT BUSINESS WEEKLY - December 30, 1996 </B>&quot;By
      the year 2000, business coaches will be as common as personal

      &quot;It helps people get more of what they want out of life
      ... Coaches are sounding boards, support systems, cheerleaders

      helping the client realize his full potential....Coaching is
      for anybody who wants more in life and is willing to take action
      to accomplish their goal.&quot; <BR>
      &nbsp; <BR>
      <B>SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS - March 13, 1996 <BR>
      </B>&quot;If you're wondering whether you need a coach, first
      ask yourself honestly: Do I waste time because I don't prioritize
      tasks effectively? Do my workers hate me? Do I have trouble communicating
      effectively? Do I spend too much time at work and not enough
