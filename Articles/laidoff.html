      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Top 10 Things to Do if You're
      Laid Off</FONT></B></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Being downsized, dismissed, let
      go of or laid off is never easy. No matter how much information
      we're privy to regarding our company or industry, it's always
      a shock when we're the casualty.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Here are 10 things to do should
      this happen to you.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">1. Regroup.</FONT></B><FONT
       SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> <BR>
      Experience the shock, hurt and anger that you're experiencing
      but don't get stuck in the feelings. Instead, focus on the future
      and what it is you most want and need.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">2. Mobilize. <BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Mobilize your resources.
      List every idea you have about what you think you'll need to
      do. Get the ideas out of your brain and onto paper. This will
      help you with brainstorming, with strategizing &amp; with mobilizing
      your resources. Immediate action is required; mobilization is
      the step preceding action.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">3. Think people. <BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">List all the people you
      know. Make a plan about how you'll approach them, and for what
      purpose. How will you explain your situation to people, and what
      is it that you'll be asking for? Get clear about this last point
      so your communication with them is productive.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">4. Think functions and transferable
      skills. <BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Think about the skills
      and talents you've tapped into in previous jobs. Creatively brainstorm
      what jobs would easily incorporate these transferable skills.
      Educators and social workers have successfully transferred their
      communication skills into corporate training positions, and financial
      planners have successfully entered other industries as analysts
      or educators. Successful sales people frequently job hop industries
      -- their communication skills transcend the product or industry.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">5. Presentation Matters. <BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Immediately update and
      upgrade your resume. Have your resume clearly represent your
      personal best. Make sure that the reader has no doubt about how
      well you'd perform - have your resume express the best of who
      you are! This means that impeccability matters! Present yourself
      professionally and in a style that both flatters and communicates
      who you are. Give people a reason to hire you! If you don't effectively
      represent or promote yourself, why should a potential employer
      think that you'd effectively represent or promote their product?</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">6. Maximize resource utilization!
<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Don't dismiss newspaper
      ads because you've heard that most people don't get jobs through
      the newspaper. Think creatively about what resources are available
      to you and utilize them! Besides networking and the newspaper
      classifieds, there are professional organizations, alumni services,
      private and public employment offices. Look around your community
      for other available resources.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">7. Focus on your strengths!
<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">You're concerned about
      your future and worried about your income. While you might feel
      powerless and fearful or anxious about your lack of control,
      make a commitment to live from your strengths and not from fear.
      Identify your strengths and make a conscious decision to live
      from them - observe when you're not. The future will unfold in
      unforeseen ways when you apply and integrate this concept into
      your life. Work to maintain your self-confidence while being
      open to others' contributions. List on a piece of paper the qualities
      that make you unique and special - list your strengths, talents
      &amp; skills. Look at the list daily, and add to it when new
      insights about your strengths emerge. If YOU don't believe in
      yourself, no one else will. Focus on your strengths!</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">8. Create a personal board
      of directors.<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Consider creating your
      very own personal board of advisors. Apply Tom Peters' concept
      &quot;the brand you&quot; to your life - run your life as you
      would a business. Create a personal board of advisors who will
      contribute to your success. Invite people you respect and who
      have complementary perspectives, approaches and skills. Remember,
      we learn more from those who are different than from those who
      are similar. Differences of opinion create a more solid product.
      When others challenge you, know that they're actually helping
      to expand your vision. Let others contribute to you. Utilizing
      your very own personal board of directors will help you get beyond
      your blind spots.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">9. Invest in yourself!<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Investing time and resources
      into your personal and professional development is well worth
      the effort - regardless of your employment status. Structure
      personal/professional development into your schedule on an on-going
      basis. Consider it a necessary ingredient for success. The benefits
      will far exceed the investment.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">10. Visualize the Future.
<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Don't let logistics or
      fear that your dream is crazy or impossible stop you from visioning
      the future! There's always learning in the listening - so listen
      to your dreams. Identify the essence of what most excites you.
      Creatively brainstorm how you can live from that space more frequently,
      as the more you do, the more powerfully you'll generate the future
      you now only dream about.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The layoff may be a blessing
      in disguise. What is the Universe trying to tell you? Is this
      a wake up call of some kind? You might unknowingly be on a path
      of personal discovery - let the layoff be the catalyst for self-discovery
      and powerful actions! Perhaps it IS time to move on to something
      more challenging and exciting.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Be open and listen. They may
      be a lesson and an opportunity in this for you.<BR>
