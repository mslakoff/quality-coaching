      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Top 10 Ways To Survive A Tight
      Labor Market</FONT></B></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">In today's work environment,
      feeling vulnerable is the norm. Others around you are losing
      their jobs due to layoffs &amp; downsizing. Every day, newspapers
      report corporate dismissals. You don't want to be the next victim
      of corporate downsizing.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The word &quot;survive&quot;
      comes from the Latin word supervivere, which means &quot;to live.&quot;
      The prefix sur means &quot;over or above.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Here are some tips to help you
      survive the times &shy; so you can remain over and above the
      turmoil of the tight labor market.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">1. <B>Know your worth.</B> When
      you know your own worth, others take you more seriously because
      you take yourself more seriously. When you know and appreciate
      your own value, you're also able to better hear appreciation
      from others. The synergy created when one values oneself produces
      results far greater than when you don't acknowledge and appreciate
      yourself.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">2. <B>Know your talents &amp;
      skills</B>. You're not perfect &shy; no one is. Don't try and
      be perfect at the expense of not being yourself. If you're so
      busy expanding your horizons and becoming someone else, there's
      little opportunity to be who you are! This point ties in to knowing
      your self worth; it's difficult to know your worth if you haven't
      identified your talents and skills! Acknowledge your talents
      and skills so you can optimize what you're already good at. The
      strategy of leveraging your skills and talents to generate a
      more powerful performance is equally effective for generating
      future opportunities.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">3. <B>Stay ahead of the curve.
      </B>Top performers rarely look to see who they're ahead of during
      the race. Instead, they keep their focus on the present as well
      as the next step. They look to the horizon for the fulfillment
      of their vision. In fact, they create the future by staying ahead
      of the curve! They stay at the forefront of innovation and development
      &shy; of product &amp; of process. How can YOU stay ahead of
      the curve in your position or industry? Take steps now to create
      your future by staying ahead of the curve. Your company won't
      want to risk losing an employee who's at the forefront of innovation
      and who produces impeccable results. Create higher standards
      than what's expected of you in order to stay ahead of the game.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">4. <B>Maintain objectivity. </B>In
      as much as you give 100% of yourself to your job, it's not necessarily
      personal when corporate human resource decisions are made. Other
      forces may be at work in the decision to lay off a person or
      department. It's important to remember this during times of faltering
      confidence. Maintain perspective in order to have a positive
      attitude.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">5. <B>Stay connected! </B>Yes,
      you're overloaded at work due to increased demands. The idea
      of lunch with a colleague or a mentor is nice, but it's the lowest
      priority on your to do list. Tip: stay connected! It's much easier
      to ask people for support, job leads or information if you've
      nurtured or maintained the connections all along. People enjoy
      supporting their friends and colleagues, but no one wants to
      feel taken advantage of, or &quot;used.&quot; Show appreciation
      to co-workers and colleagues before you need their assistance.
      Stay connected!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">6. <B>Embrace change. </B>When
      you embrace change, you're more resilient and your actions more
      nimble. Don't take refuge in the status quo. Progress never resulted
      from maintaining the status quo! Innovation is messy and sometimes
      chaotic. Embracing change results in heightened awareness and
      stronger actions, as well as shifts in perspective. When you
      embrace change, you're more likely to be <B>causing</B> the change
      (or at least, flowing with it!) versus resisting it. Choice lives
      in each moment when one embraces change.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">7. <B>Nourish Yourself. </B>The
      concept of self-care remains especially important during the
      stressful times of a recession. Take time to nourish yourself
      while continuing to develop you professionally and personally.
      Nourishment isn't a luxury; it's a core ingredient of development.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">8. <B>Be Prepared. </B>Imagine
      the worst and take action before it happens! It's important to
      be fiscally responsible when facing a tightening economy. Cut
      back on luxuries if necessary and start preparing &quot;what
      if&quot; scenarios. Prepare an exit plan before you need it.
      Take action now on the &quot;what ifs&quot; so you're prepared
      should you lose your job. The actions you take will be helpful
      regardless of your job's status.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">9. <B>Brainstorm Creative Solutions.
      </B>While you may realize the importance of personal and professional
      development, you may be reluctant to invest resources into anything
      other than what's most essential - the basics. Think creatively
      for ways in which you can continue to nurture and develop yourself,
      regardless of how much money you may or may not have. Don't let
      finances be an obstacle to your development. Creative brainstorming
      can help!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">10. <B>Express gratitude. </B>It's
      difficult to be positive in the face of danger, yet having a
      positive outlook is essential. Acknowledging all that's in your
      life can help. Express appreciation for all that you have and
      all that you are. Let the people in your life know they're important
      to you. Take nothing for granted and be communicative about what
      matters the most. <BR>
