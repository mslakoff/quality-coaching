      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Ten Questions that Lead to
      Serenity</FONT></B></P>

      <P>&nbsp;</P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Inner tranquility maintained
      over time is often elusive. We yearn for harmony but frequently
      find ourselves prisoners of troubling thoughts and emotions.
      Even when we do attain a peaceful state, we find that it so easily
      slips away, despite our best intentions to maintain a sense of
      tranquility.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Life is dynamic, with an ever-present
      forward momentum. Our equilibrium changes just as the world around
      us stays in constant flux.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Because we arrive at our most
      profound truths through a personalized and experiential discourse,
      our paths to inner peace and tranquility differ -- from person
      to person, from country to country.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The challenge before us is enormous.
      To create a peaceful world requires more than treaties between
      nations; we must explore and become intimate with peace and serenity
      in a very personal way. We must understand harmony as we attempt
      to create it. We must live and breathe it. And mostly, we must
      each define it for ourselves.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Peace requires clarity and intention;
      without these, peace often falters.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Consider the following when attempting
      to define the quality of peace and serenity. As we each gain
      clarity about peace, we're one step closer to living a life of
      abundant peace and harmony.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">1. Where do peace and tranquility
      show up?</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> Peace shows
      up inour hearts. Tranquility is the quiet within that gives us
      access to our higher selves. By tapping into the quiet of our
      hearts, we experience space, flow and possibility - core ingredients
      that help us to live peacefully.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Other places that peace shows
      up is in our physical space, our relationships and in our spirituality.
      We find peace in the purpose of our lives and we experience peace
      in our careers. Additionally, we experience peace in our families
      and in our communities. We find peace in our communication and
      in who and how we are.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">2. Is serenity the absence
      of conflict, or is it a state of mind (and being) unto itself?</FONT></B><FONT
       SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> If peace and serenity is some-thing
      more than the absence of conflict, what is it? What are the core
      ingredients of peace? What qualities help to generate peace --
      both internal tranquility as well as peace between adversaries?</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">3. Is serenity maintainable
      over time?</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> If our lives
      are in a constant state of flux and forward momentum, how do
      we maintain our composure and equilibrium? How does one live
      from one's center when there are constant obstacles coming our
      way and which serve to keep us off balance, and which destabilize
      us? How does one live in tranquility when flux is all around?</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">4. Is it possible to orient
      one's self and life around the quality of serenity?</FONT></B><FONT
       SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> If so, what commitment would you need
      to make in order to do so? What would this look like? How would
      your life look or be different?</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">5. What is your experience
      of serenity?</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> When was
      the last time you paid attention to peace and tranquility, and
      your experience of it? What's not conscious is often elusive.
      Focus on the quality and the role of peace in your life in order
      to increase it.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">6. What elements contribute
      to the creation of continued peace and tranquility?</FONT></B><FONT
       SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> If we understand what contributes to
      the creation of peace and tranquility, we'll be better equipped
      to generate it in the future. We'll be able to summon the creation
      of peace through conscious thought and action.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">7. Is peace quantifiable?</FONT></B><FONT
       SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> We count the wars between nations, but
      do we count or appreciate the days of peace? We name and count
      our adversaries, but take for granted our friends and loved ones.
      How do we quantify something we all too often take for granted?</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">8. What does inner serenity
      provide us access to?</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">
      If peace is the gateway to a higher state of being, such as love,
      compassion and gratitude, how can we harness the power of peace
      and utilize it for the betterment of our lives? If peace provides
      us access to choice, opportunities and possibility, how can we
      build upon the foundational elements that generate growth built
      upon peace? What DOES peace provide us access to?</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">9. Does tranquility live anywhere
      but the present?</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> We might
      build upon the past and we might use our vision for the future
      as a source of inspiration, but tranquility exists only in the
      present moment. Understand this profound but simple concept and
      transformation becomes possible! Each moment becomes a new opportunity
      to create peace and harmony.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">10. Can peace and tranquility
      live without compassion? </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Compassion
      is an underlying tenet of peace. &quot;Compassion is the sympathetic
      consciousness of others' distress together with a desire to alleviate
      it.&quot; (Merriam-Webster Dictionary) While our motivation to
      seek peace might not always emerge from compassion, compassion
      is required for peace to hold.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&quot;Peace is not a relationship
      of nations. It is a condition of mind brought about by a serenity
      of soul. Peace is not merely an absence of war. It is also a
      state of mind. Lasting peace can come only to peaceful people.&quot;<BR>
      - Jawaharlal Nehru</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The above questions are intended
      to guide our inquiry into peace. As we become more clear about
      peace and tranquility, the qualities that both birth and maintain
      peace will become clearer for us. And with this clarity comes
      the possibility of living and breathing peacefully. True peace
      has a power onto itself - let peace transform our world abundantly!</FONT></P>
