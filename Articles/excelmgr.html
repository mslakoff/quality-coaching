      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Top 10 Qualities of an Excellent
      Manager</FONT></B></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">An excellent manager taps into
      talents and resources in order to support and bring out the best
      in others. An outstanding manager evokes possibility in others.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">1. Creativity<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Creativity is what separates
      competence from excellence. Creativity is the spark that propels
      projects forward and that captures peoples' attention. Creativity
      is the ingredient that pulls the different pieces together into
      a cohesive whole, adding zest and appeal in the process.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">2. Structure<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The context and structure
      we work within always have a set of parameters, limitations and
      guidelines. A stellar manager knows how to work within the structure
      and not let the structure impinge upon the process or the project.
      Know the structure intimately, so as to guide others to effectively
      work within the given parameters. Do this to expand beyond the
      boundaries.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">3. Intuition<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Intuition is the capacity
      of knowing without the use of rational processes; it's the cornerstone
      of emotional intelligence. People with keen insight are often
      able to sense what others are feeling and thinking; consequently,
      they're able to respond perfectly to another through their *deeper
      understanding. * The stronger one's intuition, the stronger manager
      one will be.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">4. Knowledge<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">A thorough knowledge
      base is essential. The knowledge base must be so ingrained and
      integrated into their being that they become *transparent, *
      focusing on the employee and what s/he needs to learn, versus
      focusing on the knowledge base. The excellent manager lives from
      a knowledge base, without having to draw attention to it.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">5. Commitment<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">A manager is committed
      to the success of the project and of all team members. S/he holds
      the vision for the collective team and moves the team closer
      to the end result. It's the manager's commitment that pulls the
      team forward during trying times.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">6. Being Human <BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Employees value leaders
      who are human and who don't hide behind their authority. The
      best leaders are those who aren't afraid to be themselves. Managers
      who respect and connect with others on a human level inspire
      great loyalty.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">7. <B>Versatility<BR>
      </B>Flexibility and versatility are valuable qualities in a manager.
      Beneath the flexibility and versatility is an ability to be both
      non-reactive and not attached to how things have to be. Versatility
      implies an openness &shy; this openness allows the leader to
      quickly *change on a dime* when necessary. Flexibility and versatility
      are the pathways to speedy responsiveness.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">8. Lightness<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">A stellar manager doesn't
      just produce outstanding results; s/he has fun in the process!
      Lightness doesn't impede results but rather, helps to move the
      team forward. Lightness complements the seriousness of the task
      at hand as well as the resolve of the team, therefore contributing
      to strong team results and retention.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">9. Discipline/Focus<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Discipline is the ability
      to choose and live from what one pays attention to. Discipline
      as self-mastery can be exhilarating! Role model the ability to
      live from your intention consistently and you'll role model an
      important leadership quality.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">10. Big Picture, Small Actions
<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Excellent managers see
      the big picture concurrent with managing the details. Small actions
      lead to the big picture; the excellent manager is skillful at
      doing both: think big while also paying attention to the details.</FONT></P>
