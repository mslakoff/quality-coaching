      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Top 10 Qualities to Listen
      For When Interviewing Job Applicants</FONT></B></P>

      <P>&nbsp;</P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">There's a lot to listen for in
      a conversation. When a person speaks, listen to what's NOT being
      said, as well as what's being said. The purpose of an interview
      isn't merely to learn about an applicant's skills or background
      &shy; you've already gleaned this information from their resume.
      Listen beneath the words to who a person is. Listen for the qualities
      that most matter to the position and to the company.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">1. Confidence &amp; Self Acceptance<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Beneath the surface conversation,
      listen to who a person is. Listen for how comfortable a person
      is during the silences within a conversation. All conversation
      waxes and wanes &shy; during the pauses in a conversation, listen
      for the level of confidence and self-acceptance a person has.
      When s/he pauses to gather her/his thoughts prior to answering
      your question, do you sense nervousness or anxiety? The level
      of comfort a person exhibits during the pauses within a conversation
      says a lot. Listen for the level of confidence and self-acceptance
      beneath a person's word.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">2. Follow Through &amp; Persistence<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Follow through and persistence
      is the unique ability to engage in a project and see it through
      -- at all costs. The downside of persistence is the fine line
      that exists, separating persistence from stubbornness. Think
      about the qualities that are essential to the position - then,
      upgrade those qualities, envisioning a top performer in the position.
      Identify the desired qualities for the job - then pursue a line
      of questioning that will allow the quality to emerge. What line
      of questioning will bring forth the quality you're looking for?</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">To ask the applicant to &quot;tell
      me about your follow through abilities&quot; isn't going to reveal
      anything but an artificial response. Use your own experiences
      to identify impactful questions. What line of inquiry would bring
      out YOUR perseverance? A question about personal commitments
      and passions, or a question about your project management skills?
      My guess is that you'll learn more about a person's persistence
      by asking them about their passions vs. previous job responsibilities.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">3. Integrity<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Integrity is about being
      responsible for our actions and inactions; it's about keeping
      one's word -- to oneself and to others. It's about being responsible
      for handling whatever happens, and making adjustments so problems
      don't reoccur. When one is responsible, one doesn't blame or
      complain. Listen for how the applicant responded to situations
      in the past. Does prior behavior demonstrate responsibility,
      integrity and keeping one's word? Listen for level of ownership
      and the attitude one has in accepting responsibility. (Hint:
      You'll also learn about their leadership qualities in this conversation.)</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">4. Creativity<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The most tedious jobs
      benefit when performed by a person who thinks creatively. Listen
      for the level of comfort in considering and/or behaving in an
      &quot;out of the box&quot; way. Don't confuse style with creativity.
      Creative thinkers can present very &quot;ordinary.&quot; Listen
      to a person's mind when assessing their creativity. A bold dresser
      who looks &quot;creative&quot; might very well be a rigid thinker.
      A conservatively dressed person might be an extraordinary creative
      thinker. Don't let appearances fool you.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">5. Standards<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">We're all motivated by
      our values, whether we realize it or not. Values are what motivates
      and sustains us. They are the core of who a person is. What standards
      motivate the applicant? Does s/he seem to value working hard
      and getting the job done at all costs, or does s/he place priority
      on communication? Is s/he motivated by setting standards of excellence
      and quality, or are her/his motivators about connectedness and
      team? Listen for what drives a person. By doing so, you'll have
      a better sense of &quot;job fit.&quot;<BR>
      <B><BR>
      6. Clarity of Communication<BR>
      </B>Communication isn't just about the words a person uses. It's
      also not only about the tone or affect the speaker uses. Communication
      is about being 100% responsible for the other person's listening.
      Communication is also about making a profound connection with
      another human being. It's about establishing rapport and being
      such an excellent listener that your responses perfectly answer
      the needs of the conversation.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">How strong a connection has the
      applicant made with you? Did the person present authentically
      &shy; or were they playing a role to impress you? Listen for
      how well a person listens and connects with you. This is a highly
      valuable skill &shy; with enormous benefit for your team and
      organization.<BR>
<BR>
      <B>7. Personal Philosophies &amp; Beliefs <BR>
      </B>What are the beliefs of the person? What messages do they
      embrace or are passionate about? A person's beliefs about opportunity
      will generate activity based upon their particular perspective
      and beliefs. Is their glass half full or half empty? A person's
      personal philosophy about life will tell you something about
      how they'll approach the challenges of the job. Guide the conversation
      to allow the person's belief system to emerge. Then listen for
      it.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">8. Commitment<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The word commit comes
      from the Latin word committere, which means to connect and entrust.
      Listen for a demonstration that the person has the ability to
      connect and entrust her/him self consistently to your product,
      service or organization. The ability to connect and entrust oneself
      is a key ingredient for rapport and building trust. Commitment
      is the quality that generates a consistent connection with another
      - an ability that benefits all types of relationships. Listen
      for evidence that the person can follow through on the connections
      they make - this is where commitment is found.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Connection + Consistency = Commitment</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">9. Passion<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Success comes effortlessly
      to the person who's doing work they're passionate about. But,
      must a salesperson be passionate about their product to be successful?
      Maybe not. Listen for what the person's most passionate about
      - is s/he a people person or is s/he passionate about analysis?
      What motivates a person and lights their passion? When do their
      eyes sparkle with excitement? The more aligned a person is to
      their job, the more passionate and successful they and you will
      be.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">10. Authenticity<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Warren Bennis, professor
      and noted author of more than 20 books on leadership, change
      &amp; management and who's advised 4 U.S. Presidents, speaks
      about authenticity as a core ingredient of leadership. He says:
      &quot;Becoming a leader is synonymous with becoming yourself.
      It is that simple. It is that difficult.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">How genuine is the person during
      the interview process? How comfortable with oneself does she/he
      appear? Authenticity is about being real &amp; about being genuine
      - listen for conflicts that get in the way of a person's authenticity.</FONT></P>
