      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Top 10 Qualities of Excellence</FONT></B></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">1. Natural Talent - Know Your
      Brilliance!</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
      An uncut diamond has a wealth of unrealized possibility and brilliance.
      The beauty inherent in the diamond beckons us to develop its
      potential. Likewise, we are at our best when we develop our natural
      talent. Know your brilliance and learn to become it every day.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">2. Invest in your success.
<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Life rewards those who
      are invested in their success. If you're ambivalent about what
      you really want, you won't get what's most important. Let what
      ever it is you're striving for mean something to you! Don't stay
      stuck if you're not happy or making progress. Invest in your
      success so you're completely passionate and motivated towards
      realizing your dream. Believe in your dream and you'll be invested
      in the creation of your success.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">3. Integrity <BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">When you have integrity,
      your word means something. If people can't depend on your word,
      integrity's lacking. If your actions aren't aligned with your
      words, a disconnect occurs &shy; this disconnect then compromises
      your<I> </I>integrity. Integrity is the quality of being complete
      and undivided &shy; living from &quot;what's right.&quot; Live
      life so that you are always in a state of integrity.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">4. Passion<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Passion is that which
      deeply moves us. It's the fire from within and that which motivates
      us. Passion deeply stirs us and compels us into action. Passion
      gives us the ability to be touched, moved and inspired. Passion
      is at the core of excellence &shy; tap into yours and let it
      guide your vision!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">5. <B>High Standards <BR>
      </B>Excellence implies striving for quality. Standards of excellence
      are those that are flawless and impeccable. Do you complete work?
      Do you surround yourself with people who nourish your spirit
      and intellect? Do you address discrepancies or concerns on the
      spot? Good isn't enough; we need to exceed expectations and continually
      raise the bar for excellence. In this way, quality is continually
      generated.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">6. Creativity and Innovation<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Creativity and innovation
      require openness and questioning. The belief that anything's
      possible paves the way for creative thinking. *Outside of the
      box* thinking produces innovation, and what company doesn't want
      to be at the forefront of innovation? Creativity and innovation
      require a boldness to play and discover... to be comfortable
      enough to admit that one doesn't know the answers. It's in the
      openness to not knowing the answers that allow creativity and
      innovation to be born.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">7. <B>Self Awareness<BR>
      </B>Self-awareness, particularly about the supports and structures
      that bring out our best, is key. Lacking self-awareness is like
      stumbling in the dark - one randomly bumps into what one is looking
      for. Contrast this to knowing exactly the supports and structures
      that support you. With self-awareness, one is able to get oneself
      *into the zone* with precision and accuracy. Pay attention and
      observe yourself to enhance your self-awareness skills. </FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">8. Commitment<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Commitment implies a
      willingness and a *stick-to-it-ness.* If one is committed, one's
      support is uncompromising and unending. One is willing to do
      anything in support of the commitment. Commitment drives us and
      anchors us during challenging times. Commitment enables us to
      maintain a high degree of perseverance. Commitment opens the
      door to self-mastery and excellence.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">9. Showing Up<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">It doesn't matter HOW
      we show up, what matters is THAT we show up. Day after day, step
      after step. Don't let temporary obstacles keep you from showing
      up on a day to day basis. Pace yourself like an athlete and learn
      to develop new habits by incorporating the behavior on a day
      to day to day basis. Show up no matter what, and you'll gain
      stability and forward momentum as you move your vision forward.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">10. Contribution<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Looking back, what do
      you want the memories of your life to be? Excellence isn't solely
      about success, measured by how much money or notoriety we gain.
      Success is definitely not excellence if we've stomped on people
      en route to our goals!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Excellence is about contributing
      our best to the world while evoking others to do the same. It's
      about understanding our place and making our mark in the world,
      as we attempt to make it a better place. Excellence is about
      contribution and honoring others as we move forward towards our
      vision. Excellence lies in the hearts of all who evoke it in
      others by mentoring, supporting, exemplifying and giving back.</FONT></P>
