      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Top Ten Ways to Job-Proof
      Your Career!</FONT></B></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">It's an economically turbulent
      time. While it's always important to look at one's career goals
      and strategies for achievement, the pressure of living in a recessionary
      environment increases our anxiety about our job status. Consider
      refining and upgrading the following in order to &quot;job-proof&quot;
      your career - a wise step given these economically turbulent
      times.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">1. Vision<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Know what you want and
      where you're heading! This not only supports one's growth and
      development; it also enlarges one's perspective. Knowing your
      vision will help keep you focused and on a forward momentum!
      Vision provides the motivation and the inspiration to stay clearly
      focused on one's goals.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">2. Proficiency<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Skill, passion and an
      astute understanding of one's role contribute to proficiency.
      We all enjoy working with professionals who orient themselves
      around quality and excellence; we enjoy the feeling of confidence
      that they inspire in us. These are the people with whom we want
      to work and likewise, the people we must be in order to attract
      the customers we want!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">So identify YOUR proficiencies
      and where there's room for growth. Consider also how you might
      leverage and build upon your strengths in order to create even
      greater success!</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">3. Is It Always the People
      One Knows?<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">How many of you know
      someone who's technically inferior to you, but who always gets
      the job based on who they know and how they relate to others?
      It might not seem fair, but those with great social skills and
      ability to connect well with others DO have an advantage. They
      have ears and voices in places that extend beyond their personal
      experience. They inspire confidence in others -- and in return,
      others trust them. Working with someone you enjoy makes the interaction
      or activity a profoundly more positive experience. We ALL enjoy
      working with people with whom we get along.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Think about how you might build
      upon the network of people you know, as well as how you might
      upgrade your relationships and social skills. Building community
      will help you build your career - so consider how you might build
      upon and improve yours.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">4. Communicate Your Vision<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Communicating your vision
      to others is key for career development. Communicate with passion
      and specificity! Communicating your vision will exponentially
      expand the possibilities available. Involving others in your
      life and therefore in your success creates manifold opportunities
      for success!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Don't be silent! Be passionate
      about your vision and others will be enrolled in your project
      as well -- without you having to sell a thing! Passion generates
      excitement and others will be attracted to your project by sheer
      virtue of your vision speaking to them. Let your vision resonate
      in others - communicate to the world!</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">5. Contribution<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">We all enjoy the opportunity
      of contributing to another's success, particularly if we like
      and respect the person. Consider who contributes to your life
      - express acknowledgement and appreciation to them. More importantly,
      consider how you can increase the level and quality of contribution
      that YOU offer others -- generosity is often reciprocal and builds
      upon itself! Look for ways to positively contribute to people;
      be generous with others!</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">6. Know your value<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Knowing your value is
      integral to success in any environment. When one knows one's
      value, one is confident and has a level of self-awareness that's
      instructional. When one knows one's standards and boundaries,
      others are less likely to violate them. Pay attention to yourself,
      to what &quot;makes you tick,&quot; and know your value!</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">7. Be prepared and be agile.<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Life doesn't always happen
      smoothly - it's difficult to predict the future when we know
      that life's biggest opportunities sometimes emerge at the most
      inopportune times. Yet, what feels like an obstacle can turn
      out to be a fabulous opportunity!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">We don't always have the luxury
      of time when deciding our futures. Be prepared to take immediate
      action when opportunities arise. Create space in order to be
      better prepared to act quickly, when the need arises.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">8. What? A Plan?<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">We spend more time planning
      our vacations than we do our career. Whatever the economic climate,
      it's important to create a plan that supports our vision. Be
      realistic yet stretch yourself. Not being realistic is setting
      your self up for failure, yet not stretching yourself is limiting.
      Have your plan be realistic, inspiring and challenging - stretch
      yourself!</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">9. Lifelong Learning<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Keeping your skills and
      knowledge not just current but cutting edge will undoubtedly
      give you a competitive edge. A passion for continual life-long
      learning is key and provides unparalleled benefits for growth
      and opportunity! Look for ways to continually develop your self!</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">10. Create Possibility! <BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Even if the country's
      in a recessionary environment, it doesn't mean that you should
      turn inward, become hopeless and risk the challenge of not living
      your dream. Don't let recessionary fears inhibit you from taking
      bold actions! Fear comes from the past and limits us, whereas
      opportunity is created in the moment. Stay focused on the present
      and create opportunity through every day living! A coach can
      help with this!</FONT></P>
