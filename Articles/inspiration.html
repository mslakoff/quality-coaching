      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The word inspire comes from the
      Latin word for inspirare, <BR>
      which means to breath upon or into. When we inspire others, <BR>
      we're living from our higher selves. When we're being inspired,
<BR>
      we expand beyond what we previously were, or know our selves
<BR>
      to be. Our lives have new breath. Our soul and our actions <BR>
      are one. <BR>
<BR>
      <B>1. Know what inspires you.</B> Go back to your memories and
<BR>
      recall when you felt most inspired. What was the common <BR>
      thread amongst the different times when you've been inspired?
<BR>
      Was it a quality about another person or your self? Was there
<BR>
      a theme to the times when you've been inspired, or have been
<BR>
      inspiring? Was it an action that a person took - or that you
<BR>
      took? Think about what's inspired you in the past. Look to <BR>
      see what's missing now. <BR>
<BR>
      <B>2. Learn to live with ambivalence while striving for perfection.
<BR>
      </B>Inspiration lives between the two spaces of ambivalence and
<BR>
      perfection. Inspiration speaks to the best within our selves
      - <BR>
      ambivalence is the messiness of our lives, the life process.
<BR>
      Perfection is the ideal, while ambivalence is its application.
<BR>
      Inspiration is what moves us forward in life - through the <BR>
      ambivalence and towards the ideal. <BR>
<BR>
      <B>3. Take a break from your life.</B> Go to a movie or hike
      a <BR>
      mountain to its highest vista. Surround yourself with the <BR>
      sound of the rhythm of water, while the warmth of the sun <BR>
      energizes your body. Move your body so you feel its life. <BR>
      Keep your focus on nothing other than your experience. Live <BR>
      in the present. <BR>
<BR>
      <B>4. Inspiration isn't only what's done TO you.</B> Being inspired
<BR>
      requires an openness of heart and spirit. Create an environ-
<BR>
      ment that supports an open heart, so that inspiration blossoms
<BR>
      in your life. Just as a flower needs soil and water, so too <BR>
      does inspiration need openness of heart and spirit. Inspiration
<BR>
      can't exist without this. <BR>
<BR>
      <B>5. Sometimes we fall before we stand.</B> Don't beat yourself
      up <BR>
      when you fall from grace. Life is a process and isn't static.
<BR>
      When you fall, don't beat yourself up for falling. Acknowledge
<BR>
      the fall and it's impact on your life. At some point, you'll
<BR>
      take action and stand up. Trust the process. <BR>
<BR>
      <B>6. Divert your attention.</B> Forget about the joys that inspiration
<BR>
      brings, and live from another domain. An inspired life isn't
<BR>
      only about inspiration. It's also about exhilaration, about <BR>
      passion and living life fully. Do something completely different
<BR>
      than you normally would. Strike up a conversation with someone
<BR>
      you typically wouldn't, and approach the conversation with <BR>
      naivete, openness and depth. There's a good chance that <BR>
      inspiration will come to you when you're least looking for it.
<BR>
<BR>
      <B>7. Surround yourself with what inspires you.</B> If a certain
<BR>
      type of person inspires you, follow and nurture the attraction.
<BR>
      Trust what inspires you, and let it guide your actions. If <BR>
      a Wagner opera inspires you, surround yourself with it's <BR>
      music so you feel completely at one with the music, and with
<BR>
      what inspires you. Lose yourself in what you love and be <BR>
      inspired. <BR>
<BR>
      <B>8. Get outside of yourself.</B> Though you think you know
      what <BR>
      inspires you based on past experiences - this doesn't mean <BR>
      that you can't be inspired by something new that previously <BR>
      didn't effect you. Live in the present and pay attention to <BR>
      what tugs at your heart. This will give you a hint to newer <BR>
      sources of inspiration. <BR>
<BR>
      <B>9. Grace + openness + life + soul = inspiration.</B> Create
      a <BR>
      formula consisting of the ingredients that define inspiration
<BR>
      for you. We all have different perceptions and experiences <BR>
      of inspiration. Define what it is for you. <BR>
<BR>
      <B>10. Inspiration is a quality and a state of being.</B> To
      be <BR>
      inspiring to others is to be self-generative and inspiring <BR>
      to our selves. How can you be more self-generative? One <BR>
      must live in a state of being that allows for inspiration <BR>
      to take root. How can you cause and create your own source <BR>
      of inspiration? Where are you self-generative in your life, <BR>
      and how can you be more self-generative? <BR>
