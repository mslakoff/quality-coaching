      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Ten Items You'll Need to Decide
      in Setting Up Your Coaching Practice</FONT></B></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">1. Phone <BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">What telephone number
      will you use? Will you use a separate number from your home/office
      or the same? Do you have the phone services that you'll need?
      (There are a range of services available, such as voice mail
      and call forwarding to your cell phone.) Will you call your clients
      or will they call you? Will you have a toll free number or let
      your clients bear the cost of the call? Do you have a suitable
      telephone and headset (even for your cell phone)? What type of
      voice mail will you utilize?</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">2. Correspondence<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">How will correspondence
      reach you? Do you want your mail delivered to your home office,
      or to a P.O. box? (There may be privacy or safety issues involved
      in this decision.) Also, do you have a robust and flexible email
      program (e.g. Eudora or Microsoft Outlook)? Some email programs
      provide other integrated tools, such as a contact manager, journal,
      schedule, calendar, etc.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">3. Business Structure<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">What will your business
      structure look like? Will you incorporate and what form will
      this take? There are several options (LLC, Sub-Chapter S, etc.)
      Seek professional advice from your accountant and/or lawyer to
      decide what works best for you. Think through what systems you'll
      need to support the business you want.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">4. Finances<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">How will your customers
      pay you? Will you accept checks only or will you get a merchant
      credit account? Will you arrange a pre-payment bonus for customers
      willing to pay in advance? Will you invoice, and if so, when
      and how?</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">5. Marketing Material<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Marketing material is
      the message that you deliver to potential customers. It may take
      awhile to discern what your unique message is. In the mean time,
      use material that your coach training institute &amp;/or mentor
      coach provides. Seek support from fellow coaches. Our coaching
      community is generous; most of us are quite willing to share
      information &amp;/or resources.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">6. Organizational Systems<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">What information do you
      need and how will you organize it so as to create a system that's
      efficient, effective and effortless? Anticipate what you'll need
      in order to create a system, even if you revise it later. Better
      to start somewhere than not start at all. Prevent chaos by consulting
      with an organizational specialist (professional organizer) to
      set up the system so all you need to do is maintain it. Consider
      contact management software (e.g. Act! or Goldmine), financial
      software (e.g. Quicken or Microsoft Money), a paper or softward
      calendar (Franklin Planner, Microsoft Outlook, etc.), and a PDA
      (e.g. a Palm Pilot, Handspring Visor, etc.).</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">7. Vision<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">A market and niche often
      require time to develop. It's not too early to envision how you
      see yourself and your business. Do you see yourself having a
      solo practice or do you envision building a structure that would
      include associates? (Also consider the possiblity of joining
      an establishied coaching company.) Can you imagine coaching as
      your sole career &amp; livelihood, or do you see yourself offering
      non-related products or services concurrent with your coaching
      practice? Don't worry that you might not know the answers yet
      -- just live with the questions.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">8. Reserve<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">As long as you think
      it will take to build a sustainable practice, it most likely
      will take longer. Building a sustainable practice requires time,
      energy, commitment, perseverance, strategy, and support (financial
      and emotional). Transitions take time. Do the people in your
      life understand and support your endeavor? If not, now's the
      time for open discussion about how to build or enhance their
      support. Without a reserve of support (all types), your transition
      to a coaching practice will be immensely more difficult.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">9. Niche/Market<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">It's not necessary to
      know what niche &amp; market you'll serve in order to begin a
      coaching practice. In as much as many coaches begin coaching
      with former or current work associates, be open to all possibilities.
      Have coaching conversations where ever you are and see who comes
      to you. You may be surprised that the niche and market that's
      drawn to you are quite different than who you thought they would
      be. Stay open to possibilities.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">10. Passion &amp; Commitment<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Being a coach and building
      a practice can be difficult. You will experience unforeseen challenges.
      These challenges will test your commitment and decision to build
      a coaching practice.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">In order to coach, there must
      be nothing that gets in the way of the listening. This means
      that you can't close the door to your own struggles and experience.
      You can't avoid your personal life if there's something that
      needs to be acknowledged... and expect your coaching practice
      to excel. Integrity involves paying attention to and handling
      everything that's in your life -- whether you like it or not.
      This can be confronting.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">That's why it's so important
      to know your passion and commitment. Knowing your passion and
      commitment will help pull you through the challenging times.
      Stay close to your passion and live from it -- this is what draws
      you to coaching. Commitment is what anchors you during the rougher
      times. Know both your passion and commitment.</FONT></P>
