      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">How to Guide Yourself Through
      a Career Transition</FONT></B></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Whether you work for a start-up,
      a corporation or are a &quot;free agent,&quot; it's important
      to take inventory &shy; both personally and professionally. Take
      time to identify your aspirations and goals, your skills, preferences
      and requirements. Doing this will greatly increase the odds that
      the job you obtain be a perfect fit.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">1. <B>Assess what your greatest
      talents and skills are. </B>The answers to this question might
      seem obvious at first glance. Dig deeper and answer the question
      holistically. While technical skills are highly in demand, so
      too are people skills &shy; don't neglect your personal attributes.
      Ask 5 people who know you in different capacities to write down
      what they see as your greatest talents &shy; ask them to not
      hold back and to be honest in their replies. You may discover
      talents you previously took for granted. Listen to what others
      say.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">2. <B>List the functions of the
      jobs you've most loved. </B>You might learn something about yourself
      in looking at the similar features and functions of previously
      held and enjoyed jobs.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">3. <B>List any criteria you consider
      important in a position. </B>For one person, it may be autonomy,
      for another person, it may be working within a great team. The
      important thing to remember is that it's not only job function
      that brings satisfaction &shy; it's also the context of the position.
      Think about the context of the positions you're looking into
      &shy; then consider what contexts bring out your best.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">4. <B>Look around, listen to
      others, look to see the many possibilities available, </B>but
      don't get lost in the possibilities. Sometimes seeing so many
      possibilities increases our confusion. Knowing what the options
      are is great, but it's important to be clear about what you most
      want, about what's most important to you in a position or career.
      Without this, it's easy to make bad choices, or make decisions
      for the wrong reasons. Stay focused on the internal questions
      while exploring the possibilities.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">5. <B>Opportunity isn't something
      that happens to you, it's something you create. </B>There's an
      art to creating opportunity &shy; it's an attitude and a skill
      set. It's a way of being in the world, and causing what you most
      want, to happen. Learn to create opportunity. Be open to the
      possibilities that exist on a moment to moment basis. Take initiative.
      Generate possibility!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">6. <B>Visualize the future &shy;
      picture your ideal work day one year from today. </B>Describe
      what you're doing and where you're doing it. Compare the results
      of your visualized workday with your current situation. This
      will help you to identify the gap between where you are and where
      you want to be. Doing this exercise will help you to more clearly
      refine your vision of the future.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">7. <B>Be prepared for the opportunities!</B>
      All the opportunities in the world aren't going to open any doors
      for you if you're unable to act on them in a timely and professional
      manner. Learn to eliminate delay so you can respond immediately.
      Tie up loose ends so you're able to quickly respond to situations
      that are ripe with opportunity. Sometimes timing is everything;
      be prepared.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">8. <B>Become deeply and broadly
      knowledgeable about the industry you're interested in. </B>The
      more you know about the industry, the marketplace and the position,
      the more informed you'll be when it comes to making decisions.
      Educate yourself and do research. Brainstorm creative ways to
      get the information that will answer your questions. Involve
      others in your research campaign.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">9. <B>Create your own personal
      Board of Advisors</B>. Consider what perspectives are missing
      in your view of the world. Identify what those perspectives are,
      and who might fill in the gaps and become a member of your &quot;personal
      board of advisors.&quot; Too often we limit the ways we allow
      others to contribute to us. Be open as to how a person might
      contribute to you. Remember to always express gratitude for their
      input.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">10. <B>Schedule time off for
      yourself. </B>As focused as you might be on your career transition,
      it's important to take time off. Enjoy life independent from
      your role of employee, manager, or leader. Learn another language,
      take tai chi or music lessons, or do weight training. Develop
      yourself in ways that are unrelated to your roles in life. You'll
      be more powerful and effective as a result of taking this time
      for yourself.<BR>
