      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Top 10 Ways to Communicate
      Powerfully!</FONT></B></P>

      <P>&nbsp;</P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Communication is more than the
      words we speak. Communication is about who we are and how we
      express ourselves and relate to the world. Communication is the
      message we deliver through nonverbal as well as verbal means.
      Communication is the ultimate expression of who we are.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Here are 10 ideas to consider.
      Experiment with these ideas to begin to experience communication
      and life more powerfully.</FONT></P>

      <P>&nbsp;</P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">1. Be clear about what you
      want to express. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">What
      do you most want the other person or organization to understand?
      What is the primary idea, concept or message you want the other
      to understand as a result of your communication? Often we spend
      more time speaking about superficial matters rather than addressing
      the core, significant and underlying concepts. To communicate
      effectively with another requires an inner clarity and a thorough
      communication with your self (You can't make a request if you
      don't know what you want!). (Tip: Check in with yourself frequently
      and ask yourself what you most want from the situation. Any situation.)</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">2. Tact and good manners matter.
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">But don't let good manners
      inhibit you from speaking your truth! If your communication isn't
      honest, integrity is lost and relationships suffer. Tact matters
      as much as honesty! (Tip: Ask yourself if you're hiding under
      the pretense of manners because &quot;I don't want to hurt their
      feelings.&quot; Are you using this as an excuse to avoid acknowledging
      or expressing your perspective? Develop tact and be compassionate
      in your truthfulness.)</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">3. Precision matters. </FONT></B><FONT
       SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Expressing yourself fully involves choosing
      your words precisely. We're frequently sloppy in our communication
      and speak in vague terms. What suffers is that concepts and feelings
      don't come to life when we're not communicating clearly - our
      communication doesn't sparkle with life! Effective communication
      involves using precise language - words that accurately reflect
      and express our experience, perceptions, dreams, desires and
      disappointments. (Tip: the more specific your words are, the
      more profoundly others will understand you.)</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">4. Perspective matters. </FONT></B><FONT
       SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">From what perspective do you speak? We
      each have different perspectives based on our positions, motivations
      &amp; needs. Understand the framework you speak &amp; listen
      from. Recognize that your framework influences how you listen
      and what you listen for. (Tip: Enhance communication by observing
      the filters and paradigms we listen through.)</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">5. Diversity &amp; Common
      Ground. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Diversity contributes
      an unparalleled richness and depth to our experience. Diversity
      expands our perspective and therefore, our communication. Learn
      the art of integrating diverse viewpoints by identifying the
      common ground. Identify the interests of the person you're speaking
      with, so as to find the shared purpose, perspective, motivator
      or values. This is essential for rapport and consensus building.
      (Tip: Identify and speak from common ground even as we live &amp;
      communicate our differences. Appreciate that diverse viewpoints
      enlarge our perspective. Honor the differences and incorporate
      them into your perspective for a richer and more powerful communication.
      Create a context large enough to hold diverse viewpoints. )</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">6. Alignment &amp; Congruency.</FONT></B><FONT
       SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> When words and actions are aligned,
      powerful results occur! Lack of alignment between words and action
      creates conflict and results in a loss of power<I>. </I>The more
      consistently we align our actions with our values &amp; intentions,
      the more powerful our communication becomes. (Tip: check in with
      yourself to ensure that your actions are consistently aligned
      with your intentions.)</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">7. Silence.</FONT></B><FONT
       SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> Communication isn't only the words a
      person verbalizes - it's also the silence between the words.
      We learn about each other by what we don't say as much as by
      what we say. We learn about each other by listening to which
      topics we discuss as well as the ones we avoid. This occurs in
      all types of relationships - organizational, professional and
      intimate<I>.</I> What topics does your organization NOT discuss?
      What topics are avoided by your business partner or by your spouse?
      What do YOU avoid? (Tip: Listen to the silences as much as to
      the words for a deeper understanding of who the person or organization
      is.)</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">8. The nature of conflict.
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Conflict &amp; differences
      of opinion are inevitable, unavoidable and enormously productive.
      We learn more from differences of opinion than from validation.
      While validation provides support &amp; encouragement, it's our
      differences that create an expanded product or viewpoint. Don't
      avoid conflict -- seek to communicate with those who appreciate
      &amp; can communicate differences of opinion. (Tip: Diversity
      expands our possibilities! Develop the skill of mediation so
      as to create powerful and synergistic outcomes.)</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">9. Communication contains
      context, text and subtext. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Communication
      is the sum of our perspective (context), the words we use (text)
      as well as our personal motivators and perspectives (subtext).
      Subtext is also the meaning and the emotions that we assign to
      the text.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Communication involves all of
      these things. Effective communication therefore requires awareness,
      flexibility and an acute yet agile listening - there's a lot
      to listen for! (Tip: Pay attention to context, text and subtext
      for a more thorough listening &amp; communication.)</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">10. Responsibility. </FONT></B><FONT
       SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Communication is about being 100% responsible
      for the other person's listening. This means that if you don't
      feel understood, you've not completed the job of communicating.
      Don't blame others for their not hearing you; take responsibility
      for re-communicating your position to ensure that you've been
      properly heard. Take responsibility not only for what you say,
      but also for how you're heard! (Tip: Don't be attached to your
      choice of words! Be flexible in your communication &amp; be willing
      to re-think how you can communicate a concept in a different
      way, so it can be heard. Play with your words until you've found
      the words that properly express what you want to say. Re-format
      your ideas if necessary.)</FONT></P>
