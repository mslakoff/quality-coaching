      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Top 10 Ways to Upgrade Your
      Life in 2002</FONT></B></P>

      <P>&nbsp;</P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Goals are the plateaus we arrive
      at en route to our vision. Some of us have career goals while
      others have business goals. We also have personal, political
      and spiritual goals. For maximum momentum towards the realization
      of your goals, &quot;try on&quot; the following approaches for
      quantum leaps in 2002!</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">1. Alignment<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Align your goals with
      your values for a deeper sense of fulfillment in life. Let your
      goals be a reflection of your higher<I> </I>self &shy; let the
      goals express who you are, your values and what you want. With
      close alignment, you'll have deeper satisfaction, and success
      will come to you effortlessly!</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">2. Design an Environment That
      Evolves You!<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Instead of focusing on
      changing your self, consider redesigning your environment for
      maximum results! Design an environment that supports you in being
      your best. Design an environment and let it evolve you!</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">3. Build Connections &amp;
      Community<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Too many of us don't
      know our neighbors &shy; we retreat into our homes (often in
      front of the tv) and put too little effort into building community.
      Our communities have such strong potential to sustain and nurture
      us, providing us with communion and a connection to that which
      is greater than ourselves. Build community for deeper connection
      &amp; happiness!</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">4. Use Your Body!<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">When we use our bodies
      in new ways, we stretch and develop our being and our lives in
      countless ways. We gain vitality and a richer sense of self by
      being more present to our bodies. So pay attention to your body!
      Respect your body, challenge and develop it for greater vitality.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">5. Take Risks &amp; Experiment!<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Do things differently
      for the sheer sake of experimentation! Take risks and don't hold
      back; face your fears and experiment with new approaches! Don't
      get attached to how things have been done in the past, or to
      how you think something needs to be done &shy; delight in the
      process of experimentation!</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">6. Breakdowns Create Breakthroughs!<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Breakdowns provide access
      to breakthroughs! Next time you experience a breakdown, instead
      of getting stuck in the breakdown &shy; ask yourself what breakthrough
      you'd like to occur. By viewing the breakdown as an opportunity
      for growth, you'll create instantaneous access to transformation</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">7. Live from Your Strengths<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Identify the qualities
      that make you special. Identify what you're most passionate about
      and you'll find your strengths. Too many of us focus on self-improvement
      at the expense of not paying enough attention to what makes us
      special and unique. So identify your strengths, and live from
      them more purposefully! (For greater clarity, ask others for
      their perceptions regarding your strengths!)</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">8. Listen to What Makes Your
      Heart Sing!<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Pay attention to what
      brings you happiness. Listen to what makes your heart sing --
      and not only to what your brain thinks is in your best interest.
      Many of us live lives that have nothing to do with what makes
      us happy. Listen to what brings out your best and to what makes
      your heart sing!</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">9. Take Action Whenever There's
      Fear!<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">There's a lot to be said
      about facing your fears! By acting on our fears, we overcome
      them and at the same time, gain personal power. Challenge yourself
      to take action whenever you experience fear, and grow by leaps
      and bounds!</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">10. Don't Hold Back!<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">We all have many reasons
      to hold back. We don't want to hurt someone's feelings, it's
      not culturally acceptable or we'd jeopardize our position at
      work if we tell the truth about what we really think or feel.
      However, we also know that holding back results in loss of personal
      power and effectiveness. Don't hold back from expressing yourself!
      Be tactful, yet honest for maximum effectiveness in communication.</FONT></P>
