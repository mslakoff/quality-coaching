      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Top 10 Tips for Successful
      Interviewing</FONT></B></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Fear, anxiety, dread and nervousness
      are predominant reactions many of us have to the interviewing
      process. We're concerned that we won't present the &quot;right&quot;
      image or won't say the &quot;right&quot; words. We want approval
      and job offers but not the stress that a job search brings. Here
      are ten tips to support you during the interview phase of your
      job search.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">1. <B>Remember that the interview
      is just an interview. </B>An interview is a conversation and
      a mutual exchange of information &shy; the interviewer is learning
      about you while you're learning about the company and the position.
      Use this opportunity to your advantage! Think through in advance
      what you most want to communicate about yourself &shy; your skills,
      personal attributes &amp; professionalism. Think through in advance
      what you most want to learn about the company and position. Ask
      intelligent questions that demonstrate your range, depth and
      curiosity.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">2. <B>Be clear on your objectives.
      </B>Clarity is attractive &shy; a willingness to take or do anything
      is not. Be clear about what you want as well as what you don't
      want &shy; those who express a willingness to take anything often
      get nothing! Be prepared to state your objective, relevant experience,
      education and career goals. Tie your responses to the company's
      mission or to the function of the position you're interviewing
      for. Alignment and creating mutually beneficial alliances is
      attractive. Demonstrate this within the interview.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">3. <B>Be clear on your strengths.
      </B>Even if you're not directly asked this question, know that
      the interviewer is assessing you and the conversation in order
      to get this information. In addition to being clear on your strengths,
      be prepared to relate your strengths specifically to the position
      for which you're being considered. You can do this even if you've
      not specifically been asked about your strengths and weaknesses.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">4. <B>Know how to describe your
      weaknesses as strengths. </B>There are two effective ways to
      communicate your weaknesses. One way is to communicate your weakness
      in the context of what you've learned as a result of the weakness.
      This is effective because you're demonstrating the ability to
      learn from your mistakes. Another effective way to discuss your
      weaknesses is to demonstrate that your weakness is actually a
      strength. For example, you might respond, &quot;One of my weaknesses
      is that I tend to be impatient with people who aren't willing
      to give 110% to their jobs.&quot; Speak about a weakness from
      a strengths perspective. Isn't persistence really just stubbornness
      wrapped inside a different word?</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">5. <B>Prepare, prepare and prepare.
      </B>Before the interview, prepare responses to all the possible
      questions you may be asked &shy; then prepare, prepare and prepare!
      Practice answering &quot;mock&quot; questions, or, audio or video
      tape your responses if you don't have someone with whom you can
      role-play. Practice and prepare until your responses are completely
      natural and roll off your tongue. Saying the words out loud and
      not only in your mind makes a difference.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">6. <B>Make contact. </B>We're
      all human beings and enjoy making contact with one another. We
      all appreciate authenticity. If two individuals have equal ability,
      training &amp; experience &shy; which will be the person hired?
      Most likely, the person who makes the strongest or more positive
      connection with the interviewer will be the person hired. Get
      out of your comfort zone and establish contact with your interviewer
      &shy; give them an opportunity to like you! Be comfortable and
      be yourself. Wouldn't <I>you</I> want to hire a person you enjoy
      being around?</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">7. <B>Focus on the needs of the
      company, not on the job you want. </B>Yes, the interview <I>is</I>
      your opportunity to create an impactful impression, but the focus
      of your attention shouldn't <I>only </I>be on getting your points
      across. Be an exceptional listener and focus on the needs of
      the company as well as how &amp; what you'd contribute. All people
      appreciate being with an excellent listener &shy; so be the excellent
      listener you are! This will help you to establish rapport. Also,
      you'll most likely learn valuable information about the company,
      the position or the interviewer that will enable you to better
      respond &shy; this will help you to make better contact and a
      strong impression.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">8. <B>Go on interviews regardless
      of your desire to work for the particular company or job. </B>Consider
      these &quot;practice interviews&quot; or/and &quot;networking
      interviews.&quot; Unless you have a specific reason for not accepting
      an interview, accept all interviews. Practice your interviewing
      skills and enjoy the process. Today's interview for a position
      you're not interested in <I>could</I> lead to tomorrow's opportunity.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">9. <B>Find ways to nourish yourself,
      especially before the interview. </B>A positive upbeat style
      enhances the image you're presenting &shy; you want to shine
      &quot;from the inside out.&quot; While skills and talents are
      essential, radiating vitality and positive energy is equally
      important. Find ways to &quot;jump-start&quot; yourself on the
      road to increased vitality &shy; this will indirectly boost your
      job prospects.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">10.</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1"
       FACE="Arial"> <B>Don't ignore the basics. </B>This means having
      a tight resume, an excellent appearance, available references
      and a well-prepared portfolio (as appropriate). Never underestimate
      the importance of professionalism, especially around the basics.
      Everything else is gravy if the basics aren't solidly anchored
      by competence and professionalism. Seek assistance for perspective
      and support, to ensure that you're putting your best foot forward.</FONT></P>
