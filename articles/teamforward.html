      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Top 10 Ways to Move a Team
      Forward</FONT></B></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">1. <B>Create a Safe Space.</B>
      Creativity, growth, innovation and self-expression are a few
      of the many qualities that emerge from a safe space. Teams are
      able to overcome great obstacles and enjoy stellar success when
      their actions are grounded and supported by the safe space the
      team has created. Respect for others is a cornerstone of a safe
      space &shy; consider what other qualities constitute a safe space
      for your team.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">2. Vision. </FONT></B><FONT
       SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Have clarity about who you are and what
      you're creating. Have the team be clear about functions and how
      you're going to work together. Let your actions emerge from this
      vision. Powerful teams that have clarity of vision often have
      unparalleled synergy and unexpected results!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">3. <B>Leadership</B>. A leader
      brings out the best in others and inspires us to be our best.
      S/he is an adept listener and knows how to marry vision &amp;
      action, structure and creativity. The most powerful teams allow
      each and every team member the opportunity to assume leadership.
      Leadership is a continuous learning journey; have your team support
      the development of all team members' leadership skills!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">4. <B>Establish common ground.</B>
      Identify the common commitment, vision and motivation of team
      members. While the commitment, vision and motivation of team
      members may differ from person to person, it's important that
      team members understand where each person is coming from.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">5. <B>Operational Framework.</B>
      Articulate the process by which the team will communicate and
      interact. Establish vehicles for communication and action. Create
      a structure that supports the team's development. What systems
      or frameworks can better support YOUR team's growth and development?</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">6. <B>Give Yourself Time.</B>
      Teams need time to become a cohesive unit. An effective team
      produces results not only based on its functional model, but
      also through the relationships that team members have with each
      other. Time allows for the development of communication styles
      and team trust.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">7. <B>Consensus through dialogue.</B>
      Build consensus through discussion and dialogue. Allow for differences
      &shy; in opinion, in style and in other ways too! Expand your
      vision by incorporating differences into the greater whole. Co-creation
      is about including different perspectives. Challenge yourself
      to always be open to looking at things from different perspectives.
      This will enlarge your vision AND results!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">8. <B>Know When to Take Action.</B>
      There's a time and place for dialogue; there's a time and place
      for action. Know how to marry the two for maximum momentum!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">9. <B>Create Structure. </B>Create
      a structure that allows for growth and multiple functions. Formulate
      the structures so anyone can fill each role; create templates
      and blueprints so others can seamlessly enter or leave the group.
      Having team members assume different roles and functions will
      help to develop ALL team members' leadership skills, resulting
      in a more powerful team!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">10. <B>Agreements.</B> How will
      the team work together? Decide on roles; be clear about team
      functions and expectations of each other. Clarify how you'll
      work together and articulate what you want to create. Agreements
      are the sub-texts behind our actions; tactfully communicate the
      agreements you have with each other in order to build a team
      that provides respect, safety and challenge for it's team members.
      Honor the agreements you make with each other.<BR>
