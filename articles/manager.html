      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Top Ten Questions to Measure
      Whether You're a Top Manager!</FONT></B></P>

      <P>&nbsp;</P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Ask a manager what kind of boss
      they are &shy; the typical response is: &quot;I do a good job.&quot;
      A manager will often respond by saying: &quot;I'm able to get
      things done. I accomplish goals within a specified time period
      and I utilize team members effectively.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
      Ask team members or employees the same question about what kind
      of boss you are, and you'll probably get a very different answer!
      Too often, we don't ask employees questions that if honestly
      answered, we'd learn a great deal from. If we'd ask questions
      that we weren't afraid of hearing the answers to, we'd learn
      enormous amounts. An inquiry of this kind could have tremendous
      impact on our personal and professional development by helping
      us to identify areas for growth based on our listening to of
      others.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Think about it. As much as you
      enjoy appreciation and validation, don't you learn more from
      differences of opinion?</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Here are some questions from
      the book &quot;First Break All The Rules&quot; (Marcus Buckingham
      and Curt Coffman &amp; The Gallop Organization) that have the
      potential for opening new horizons for growth if you listen carefully
      to the answers. Take action on the responses. As you do, you'll
      be upgrading your communication and managerial skills - becoming
      a top manager in the process!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">(Hint: you must precede your
      request for employees' opinions by demonstrating your commitment
      to a learning environment. If people don't feel safe, they won't
      speak their minds. It's up to you to create an environment that
      allows for freedom of expression for positive gain. Give permission
      and create a space for employees to speak their minds. The benefits
      will be worth it.)<BR>
      </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&quot;As for the best leaders,
      the people do not notice their existence. The next best, the
      people honor and praise. The next, the people fear; and the next,
      the people hate. When the best leader's work is done, the people
      say, 'We did it ourselves'.&quot;<BR>
      - Lao-Tzu</FONT></P>

      <P>&nbsp;</P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The questions are:</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">1. Do I know what's expected
      of me at work? Not only in terms of actual job function, but
      in a systemic context as well. Other questions include: Am I
      expected to change things or maintain the status quo? Am I expected
      to come up with new ideas, or keep my mouth shut? What is expected
      of me given the culture of my organization?<BR>
<BR>
      2. Do I have the opportunity to do what I do best every day?</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">3. Does my supervisor care about
      me as a person?</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">4. Do I have the resources I
      need?</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">5. Have I recently received recognition
      for good work?</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">6. Is there someone who encourages
      my development?</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">7. Do my opinions matter?</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">8. Do I feel that my job is important,
      within the context of the organization's long-term vision and
      mission?</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">9. Are my co-workers committed
      to excellence?</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">10. This year, have I had an
      opportunity to grow? Am I challenged and inspired in my current
      project or assignment?<BR>
