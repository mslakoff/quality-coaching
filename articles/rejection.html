      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Top 10 Ways to Deal with Job
      Rejection</FONT></B></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"></FONT></B>&nbsp;</P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">1.  Don't take it personally.</FONT></B><FONT
       SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">  Don't use the job interview as a measure
      of your professional worth.  The decision to not hire you was
      based on the company's specific criteria and needs which may
      or may not have anything to do with how you showed up at the
      interview.  That you weren't the perfect match doesn't mean that
      you're not an outstanding professional with excellent attributes
      and talents. </FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">2.  Don't get your needs met
      through the interview. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">If
      you're using the interview to satisfy your need for professional
      validation, the results will be disastrous. Get your needs met
      elsewhere and you'll be authentically confident and polished.
      </FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">3.  Don't bring up the past.
       </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">It's funny how failures
      have a way of drudging up all our past failures, as well as all
      the negative feelings associated with the failures. It's as if
      our minds go into over-drive &shy; then our collective unconscious
      kicks in and we're on autopilot into the failures of our past.
       Stay present; don't let the past take over.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">4.  Focus on your strengths.</FONT></B><FONT
       SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">  It's easy to blame yourself and focus
      on your imperfections when faced with a job rejection.  Focus
      on what you're really good at, and what you're passionate about.
       Don't beat yourself up for not being perfect.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">5.  Ask yourself questions.</FONT></B><FONT
       SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">  Ask yourself questions so you learn
      from the experience. What would you have done differently?  What
      did you learn from the interviewing process?  How would you have
      handled yourself differently?  By asking questions, we focus
      on learning and growth and consequently move forward.  </FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">6.  Accept reality.  </FONT></B><FONT
       SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Accept that rejections are a part of
      the job search.  Buttress yourself emotionally to handle the
      sadness that comes with rejection.  Know that rejection is going
      to happen repeatedly throughout our lifetime;  accept rejection
      as a part of life.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">7.  Keep it in perspective.
       </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Being rejected doesn't
      mean that your professional qualifications and personal attributes
      are anything less than spectacular.  Employers weigh many considerations
      when recruiting staff - many of these factors are beyond your
      control.  Keep it in perspective; their decision doesn't necessarily
      reflect on you.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">8.  Accept responsibility;
       don't blame others</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">.
       Without blaming yourself or beating yourself up, accept responsibility
      for your part in the rejection.  Take ownership for your contribution.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">9  You're not alone.</FONT></B><FONT
       SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">  Know that every day, countless others
      are sharing your experience.  Seek out others -- the mutual support
      and shared knowledge will be enormously helpful.  Contacts and
      job leads, as well as friendships and offers to share technical
      expertise with each other, result when connecting with others
      who are on a similar job search journey. </FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">10.  Stretch Yourself</FONT></B><FONT
       SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">!  Go to the gym and stretch beyond what
      you think your limits are.  Find a place in your life that you
      can &quot;go to the edge&quot; and be extreme. Don't take life
      so seriously. Do an activity you've never done before and you'll
      rejuvenate yourself.  This is where inspiration emerges from
      &shy; the creative places we go to when we get outside of ourselves
      and outside of our ruts.</FONT></P>
