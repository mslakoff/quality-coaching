      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Top 10 Ways to Know When to
      Leave A Job (or Company)</FONT></B></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Sometimes we stay in a position
      (or company) too long. It can be difficult at times to recognize
      the truth about our employment situation. We may stay at a job
      because we're living from a vision for the future, or a memory
      from the past. Sometimes it's best to acknowledge the present
      and simply move on.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">1. When it's the other entity
      that always sets the parameters or the rules,</FONT></B><FONT
       SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> it's time to reconsider. Your relationship
      isn't a partnership if you're not both creating the ground rules,
      or both getting essential needs met. (Hint: If you don't feel
      like a partner in the success of the business, you probably aren't
      giving it your all. It's not only about how the business treats
      you! Partnership is what you BOTH bring to the relationship.)</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">2. When your differences of
      opinion don't improve the product, </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1"
       FACE="Arial">and instead injure one's feelings or pride, it's
      time to pay attention. When both entities are committed to the
      partnership, each rises above the differences and embraces the
      best of both perspectives/approaches. It's not personal.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">3. When you've lost your sense
      of purpose,</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> it's time
      to re-evaluate what brought you into the position in the first
      place. Perhaps the job fulfilled your original objective, but
      your objectives have since changed - and it's now time to move
      on. Maybe not. The important thing is to evaluate where you are
      now, what it is you want, and whether the job or company is capable
      of satisfying your needs.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">4. When you've lost a sense
      of fun, </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">it's also time
      to re-evaluate. How can you make your job more enjoyable? How
      can you bring new life, passion or commitment to it? If you're
      not enjoying your job or your experience within the company,
      it's time to pay attention to ways in which the relationship
      can be improved. How can you bring more of yourself to your job,
      so you enjoy both your job and your self, more?</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">5. Re-look what brought you
      together in the first place.</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">
      What originally motivated your interest in the job (or company)?
      A stimulating work environment? The experience you'd get? Salary?
      A stable company? Growth opportunities? Be clear about what needs
      are getting met via the job, as well as what you contribute.
      Your original objectives might have gotten met long ago &shy;
      look to see what your needs are NOW, and whether the partnership
      still works to your mutual benefit.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">6. When one person's doing
      all the work,</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> and the
      other's not contributing to the project or the relationship with
      commitment and velocity, it's time for a review. Look at the
      balance of power, look at the workload distribution and look
      at the results. Over time, each of your contributions should
      add value to the end product and to each other, so that the sum
      total is greater than what your individual efforts would have
      been.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">7. When the commitment to
      communicate is no longer solid, </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">the
      partnership suffers. Initially, there might have been an incredibly
      synergistic relationship but you're now &quot;facing the fires&quot;
      that make or break a partnership. Communication is essential
      for keeping the partnership open and full of possibility. Respect
      is not always enough. Communication is what oil is to a car &shy;
      it lubricates the parts and keeps the engine running smoothly.
      Don't underestimate the importance of communication. What can
      you do to improve it?</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">8. If respect is lacking,</FONT></B><FONT
       SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> it's also time to evaluate. Self-respect,
      as well as respect from and for your employer, is essential.
      If your employer or supervisor doesn't respect you, that's a
      signal that something, somewhere is &quot;off.&quot; If you don't
      respect the business or the company's business practices, so
      too is something probably &quot;off.&quot; Deal with this now
      and don't ignore what needs to be acknowledged. The longer you
      put off acknowledging your experience, the harder it is to have
      respect &amp; integrity.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">9. If find yourself lying
      or not telling the truth, </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">this
      too is a sign to re-evaluate the partnership. Integrity is closely
      linked to keeping one's word. If your integrity is out, there's
      no better way to restore it, than to tell the truth. Telling
      the truth is expedient and effective &shy;just be tactful and
      respectful.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">10. If there's too much water
      under the bridge, </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">and
      not enough commitment and communication to do the work necessary
      to put the partnership back on track, the relationship may suffer.
      Take time every day to appreciate what matters. Communicate this
      to those in your life. Treat your work relationships as you would
      your personal &shy; with integrity, communication and respect.</FONT></P>
