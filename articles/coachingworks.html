      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Top 10 Reasons that Coaching
      Works!</FONT></B></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">1. Undivided Attention <BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">A coach listens to you
      with an unbiased view. A coach wants nothing more than your success
      &shy; whatever that might mean for you or however that might
      look. A coach has no *hidden agenda* and no self-interest other
      than you achieving your goals.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">2. Live Your Dreams<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">A coach doesn't just
      help you to clarify your dreams; a coach helps you to bring them
      to life! A coach stays by your side as you work to make your
      dream a reality. A coach brings visions to life!</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">3. Clarity and Self Empowerment
<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The clearer you are about
      what you want, the more effective you'll be. A coach provides
      clarity by being both a sounding board and a mirror to you. A
      coach helps you to put into words what would otherwise be left
      unsaid, were it not for the coaching. Coaching provides clarity
      and is the conduit for self-expression and empowerment!</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">4. Accountability<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Many of us are challenged
      by our goals &shy; we're frustrated with the process of how to
      accomplish our goals. Having regular appointments with a coach
      helps you to fulfill on your commitments. A coach provides follow-through
      and is someone to share your experience with.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">5. Focus<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">A coach helps to keep
      you on track. A coach helps to keep you focused on your goals,
      actions and outcomes by holding your vision for you for the times
      when it falters.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">6. Unconditional Support<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Carl Rogers, Gestalt
      psychologist defined unconditional positive regard as being &quot;an
      outgoing positive feeling without reservations, without evaluations.
      &quot; A coach's support is not conditional upon the client being
      a certain way or achieving a particular goal. A coach wants only
      for the person to realize their goals in the most effortless,
      productive and satisfying way possible. A coach creates a space
      of listening, compassion and unconditional support. These qualities
      help to create a context of acceptance and possibility &shy;
      qualities that help us to bring forth our vision.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">7. Listening<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Coaches are trained listeners.
      A coach listens to what's being said, to how you say it, to the
      messages and feelings beneath the words, as well as to what you're
      NOT saying. A coach mirrors all this back to you &shy; this is
      rich territory, full of self-discovery and &quot;a-ha's! &quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">8. Alignment<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Being driven and goal-oriented
      is meaningless if your goals aren't clearly aligned with who
      you are and what's most important to you. A coach knows this,
      and coaches from this concept: When alignment exists, fulfillment
      AND results occur!</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">9. Powerful Questions Generate
      New Possibilities<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">A coach asks questions
      that open up new perspectives and possibilities. Sometimes we
      focus too much on the details and not the larger context: both
      are important! Great questions have the power to shift paradigms
      and create new possibilities for action. Questions are powerful
      catalysts for shifting perspectives and behavior. Coaching works!</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">10. Curiosity, Wonder and
      Empowerment<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Coaches help to shift
      perspectives, approaches and attitudes. Coaches expand perspectives
      by helping the person to see alternate ways one might approach
      a situation. Coaches open your mind to new areas of development,
      generating a sense of curiosity, wonder and empowerment!</FONT></P>
