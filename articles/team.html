      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Top Ten Qualities of an Outstanding
      Team Player</FONT></B></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">1. Enthusiasm &amp; Commitment<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">An exemplary team member
      has enthusiasm for the organization and commitment for its cause.
      An outstanding team member stands behind the organization's ideals,
      vision and mission. A team player knows when to put aside the
      differences for the common good.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">2. Integrity<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Integrity is foundational
      and sets the parameters for the organization's success. The higher
      one's integrity, the higher one's success potential. An organization
      or a person can't be truly successful without integrity. Align
      your actions with your values for a high level of fulfillment
      and integrity &shy; an ideal team member's actions reflect their
      commitment to the organization and community.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">3. Competency<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">When we work with competent
      people, we're confident and trusting, knowing they'll deliver
      quality. Because one person's performance effects the functioning
      of the whole team, competency takes on great significance. Competency
      begets excellence; who can argue with that? Competency builds
      a strong team. Competency erases any cause for needless anxiety
      and is good for our mental health, as well as the health of the
      team.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">4. Creativity<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Creativity and &quot;outside
      the box&quot; thinking is key for organizational transformation
      and problem solving. Having creative thinkers on the team moves
      the organization forward in ways that can't be anticipated. Nurture
      your creative instincts and don't be afraid to share what you
      think might be unconventional ideas. Change would never occur
      if we didn't have bold &quot;outside the box&quot; thinkers!</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">5. Sense of Humor<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Lightness holds the team
      together as much as shared values and vision. Dedication and
      commitment to shared values doesn't preclude team members from
      having fun! Lightness adds perspective and helps to keep team
      members balanced. Keep your life sane so you maintain your sense
      of humor; laughter is healing, healthy and fun!</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">6. Perseverance<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Perseverance comes easily
      to those who are committed. When one is committed, one is steadfast
      in their belief of possibility. Nothing gets in the way of the
      vision. Obstacles are stepping-stones en route to fulfillment
      of the vision. Never take your eyes off the vision &shy; work
      towards the goal so that nothing stands between your team and
      the goal/vision.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">7. Language<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Language is the conduit
      for growth and self-expression. While progress can happen without
      words, it's language that brings forward our learning and experience.
      Language is the context for commitment. Language connects us
      and is a primary conduit for self-expression.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">8. The Power of Questions
<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Questions open communication;
      statements don't. Outstanding team members are inquisitive by
      nature and are open to hearing other points of view. Team members
      who appreciate the power of questions demonstrate strong teamwork
      skills. Questions move the team (and organization) forward in
      both linear and non-linear ways.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">9. Reliability &amp; Follow-Through<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">When we give our word,
      we create an expectation for others. When we deliver, others
      consider us reliable &shy; our word carries weight and means
      something. An ideal team member understands the power of the
      word and how strongly our integrity is based upon our word. Reliability
      is keeping your word, time and time again.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">10. Collaboration<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Collaboration is at its
      essence, contribution. It's what happens when we &quot;step outside
      of ourselves&quot; and honor the space we share more than where
      we each individually come from. Collaboration is what we create
      when we come together. Strong team members value the power and
      synergy of collaboration.</FONT></P>
