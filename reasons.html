      <P><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">There are hundreds
      of things you can work on with a personal coach. Here are the
      top ten:</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">1. You will
      set far better goals that motivate you in a healthy way.</FONT></B></P>

      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Did you have
      Goal Setting 101 in high school? &nbsp;Probably not. &nbsp;Enter
      the coach, an expert in helping you to identify and set the goals
      that you really want, not the ones that are &quot;shoulds,&quot;
      pipedreams, that you've been recycling or that mirror the goals
      of your parents, society or Madison Avenue. &nbsp;Choosing the
      right goals for you is an art and the coach takes the necessary
      time to help you clarify your personal values, so that you have
      something really solid on which to develop your goals.&nbsp;
      Value-based goals are naturally motivating, but it takes good
      coaching to get to these. &nbsp; <BR>
      </FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">2. You'll
      accomplish goals and tasks and projects much more quickly.</FONT></B></P>

      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">One of the reasons
      that people hire a coach is to save themselves time. Working
      with a coach, they learn how to be far more effective, efficient
      and productive in everything that they do, including their job/business
      or personal projects. &nbsp;We humans just aren't that naturally
      effective, even if we think that we are. &nbsp;The coach has
      the tools and techniques to share with their clients so that
      things get done in half the time. &nbsp;(Even the coaching process
      is efficient -- on the phone, 1/2 hour a week, reasonable fee.)
      </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial"><BR>
      &nbsp;</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> <BR>
      <B>3. You'll make fewer mistakes in your business life or in
      your personal life.</B></FONT></P>

      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The old model
      of learning from your mistakes has deteriorated to be more like:&nbsp;
      How else will you learn if you don't make mistakes? &nbsp;Too
      expensive, in our view.&nbsp; With a coach, you have a third
      eye, someone who's been there and who has coached others in your
      situation, and an expert in getting the job done with the minimum
      of fuss (called learning curve, mistakes, errors in judgment,
      wrong tunnels, etc.). &nbsp;The costs (emotional, financial,
      time) of making mistakes has gotten very expensive in the past
      decade. &nbsp;A single mistake can ruin you in today's hyper-paced
      business environment. Some clients use their coach as an inexpensive
      insurance policy.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">4. You'll
      move up to the next level of your professional and personal life.</FONT></B></P>

      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Almost everybody
      is moving up the ladder of business success, personal development,
      awareness and emotional balance. &nbsp;The coach can help you
      see where you are right now and point out ways to grow and get
      where you want to get to. &nbsp;Or, if you're not even on the
      ladder, the coach can guide you to it and help you get started
      on your path.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">5. You'll
      reduce the number of problems you have and better resolve the
      problems that are left.</FONT></B></P>

      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The first step
      in solving a problem is to ask yourself why you have this problem
      at all. &nbsp;The second step is to ask yourself why you have
      problems at all. The third step is to get on track to having
      no problems -- aka, becoming a Problem-Free Zone (PFZ). &nbsp;This
      is not a joke. &nbsp;Being a PFZ is becoming even more important
      along the path of sustainable success. &nbsp;You cannot afford
      to have problems, period. &nbsp;Life's too short and problems
      are too expensive. &nbsp;A well-trained coach can help you become
      a PFZ. &nbsp;</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial"><BR>
      &nbsp; <BR>
      </FONT><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">6. You'll
      likely make more money in your career, profession or business.</FONT></B></P>

      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Clients don't
      keep paying their coaches just for the fun of it. <B>&nbsp;</B>Coaching,
      like every other professional service, needs to improve the financial
      bottom line and it does.&nbsp; Coaches are trained to help clients
      to leverage their ability to make money, i.e., getting a raise,
      choosing a better career, starting a business, improving profitability,
      adding more value to their customers, proper pricing, productivity
      and others. &nbsp;Sure, coaching is personal, but it almost always
      includes a strong financial aspect.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">7. You'll
      be a lot happier and this happiness will last.</FONT></B></P>

      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Coaches know
      how to help you to reduce stress, integrate all aspects of your
      life, simplify or downshift, and reorient around what makes you
      the happiest. &nbsp;What good is increased productivity and profitability
      if you're not happy?</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">8. You'll
      be much more effective and influential with others: family, business
      and personal relationships.</FONT></B></P>

      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Communication
      makes life. &nbsp;A coach is an expert communicator and trains
      clients on how to come across better, relate well with others,
      listen aggressively, influence, coach, motivate and support others.
      &nbsp;There are over</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">
      </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">100 communication
      and listening skills that clients can learn from a coach.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">9. You'll
      become much more attractive to others -- on the inside and on
      the outside.</FONT></B></P>

      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Selling, as a
      profession and as a proven technique/process, is on its way out.
      &nbsp;Why? &nbsp;Because humans are getting better at choosing
      for themselves and buying better. &nbsp;Humans will respond less
      to advertising and selling techniques and instead be drawn to
      a product or service and they will be more likely drawn because
      of who is offering the product or service. &nbsp;This process
      is called attraction and Coach University wrote the book on it
      (called Irresistible Attraction). &nbsp;It's real. &nbsp;It works.
      &nbsp;And it will replace much of the promotion, marketing, selling,
      seducing and other very expensive budget items. &nbsp;Remember,
      the world (aka consumers) is rapidly eliminating virtually all
      waste and inefficiencies in how business is conducted, products
      are sold and how services are delivered. &nbsp;Selling and mass
      marketing, while certainly still very effective right now, is
      on the hit list. &nbsp;Attraction is the next generation of selling
      and the well-trained coach can help you and your business get
      on this track immediately.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">10. You'll
      have a better life, not just a better lifestyle.</FONT></B></P>

      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The term Quality
      of Life has become overused in the past few years, but the trend
      of Americans seeking to create a much better life for themselves
      is accelerating. In fact, people are re-examining what they had
      assumed a good life was (married, 2.3 kids, nice car, secure
      job, church on Sundays, 3 weeks of vacation a year) and are now
      creating their own life, often breaking the rules and flying
      in the face of conventional wisdom in the process. &nbsp;A coach
      has been trained in the Life Design process and has already made
      the kind of design changes in their life, that their clients
      are just now beginning to make.</FONT></P>
