      problem, sets the goals, and puts the action in motion -- all
      under my control. It works! Jan is committed and compassionate
      to my growth and success.&quot; <BR>

      to say to anyone who is considering personal coaching, to go
      ahead and do it.</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&nbsp;If
      you are THINKING that there is a place for coaching in your life,
      then there is a need and you are ready.&nbsp; That has been my
      personal experience in working with Jan as a personal coach.
      Immediately I began to reap the benefits.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Jan has a special
      skill in focusing on issues that block my goals.&nbsp; She picks
      up on these issues and offers exercises that provide opportunities
      to go beyond obstacles. She doesn't tell me what to do.&nbsp;
      But, rather she provides a structure that helps me remain consistently
      focused on where I want to go. Jan brought an issue to my awareness
      during our first session.&nbsp; I began to see how it was holding
      me back. By taking action and changing that one issue, I opened
      a floodgate of possibilities.&quot; <BR>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Coaching helped me to establish
      personal &amp; business focus and direction. </FONT></B><FONT
       SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">It also provided reassurance &amp; encouragement.
      I've learned to give myself permission to switch focus. This
      frees up a lot of energy, as guilt takes up time &amp; energy!
      I'm more realistic with planning &amp; time management. I've
      learned to not put too many things on my to do list &shy; but
      to focus on one thing at a time. I've learned to plan my time
      differently - different activities require different types of
      energy. Coaching motivated me to invest my time/energy into organizing
      my home &amp; work space. Getting rid of the clutter gives me
      a sense of peace &amp; order, allowing for more effectiveness
      in my home/family life &amp; work. And finally, I am more conscious
      of flexibility. Coaching helps me to realize where I'm at, where
      I'm going, &amp; what directions &amp; approaches to take.<BR>

      to break huge and occasionally overwhelming goals into smaller
      steps has helped me to overcome the immobility and hopelessness

      and creativity with a wonderful compassion that makes working
      together productive.&nbsp; Her belief that I can develop my yoga
      classes into a profitable business helps me to believe in myself.
      &nbsp;I have taken many risks I could not have taken without
      Jan's clarity and support.&quot;&nbsp;<BR>

      had a void in my life that I could not put my finger on. </FONT></B><FONT
       COLOR="#000000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I had a good job, a good
      marriage, and was living a comfortable lifestyle.&nbsp; But this
      feeling of wanting more was always in the back of my mind.&nbsp;
      Counseling was not the answer because nothing was really wrong
      and nothing needed to be &quot;fixed.&quot; A close friend told
      me about a new trend sweeping the nation and so I though I'd
      try it.&nbsp; I have a personal coach who has turned my life
      around!&nbsp; I realized I didn't want to be &quot;comfortable,&quot;&nbsp;
      I wanted to be happy and charged about living.&nbsp; Jan showed
      me how to change my attitude towards everything and I've never
      felt so complete. Having a personal coach is wonderful because
      your personal goals can change.&nbsp; And you know that there's
      this person who's there in a solid way to be there in a totally
      supportive way to help with anything!&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&quot;One day
      you might need financial advice, another day you might just need
      an attitude adjustment. It's a new lease on your life from someone
      who's not related to you, who's not judging you, and who really
      helps you take charge of your life!&nbsp; I love having a personal
      coach.&nbsp; It's like having a guardian angel who is there for
      me in any way I need her to be.&nbsp; Just knowing she's there
      for me is a security that a friend can't provide and is priceless.&nbsp;
      A personal coach is great because it's so motivating and supportive
      &shy; and it's all for you all the time in any way you want.&quot;<BR>
